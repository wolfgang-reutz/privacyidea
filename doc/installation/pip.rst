Python Package Index
--------------------

.. index:: pip install, virtual environment

You can install privacyidea usually on any Linux distribution in a python
virtual environment. This way you keep all privacyIDEA code in one defined
subdirectory.

privacyIDEA currently runs with Python 2.7 and 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8. Other
versions either do not work or are not tested.

You first need to install a package for creating a python `virtual environment
<https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_.

Now you can setup the virtual environment for privacyIDEA like this::

  virtualenv /opt/privacyidea

  cd /opt/privacyidea
  source bin/activate

.. note::
    Some distributions still ship Python 2.7 as the system python. If you want
    to use Python 3 you can create the virtual environment like this:
    `virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 /opt/privacyidea`

Now you are within the python virtual environment and you can run::

  pip install privacyidea

in order to install the latest privacyIDEA version from
`PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/privacyIDEA>`_.

.. note::
    The `setup.py` of version 3.3.3 is missing the package `cbor2`. privacyIDEA
    won't work until the `cbor2`-package is installed in the virtual environment.

To achieve a deterministic installation, you can install and pin the installed
versions like this::

  export PI_VERSION=3.3.3
  pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/privacyidea/privacyidea/v${PI_VERSION}/requirements.txt
  pip install git+https://github.com/privacyidea/privacyidea.git@v${PI_VERSION}

.. note::
    The requirements file for version 3.3.3 pins a version of the
    `cbor2` package which requires to rebuild some components. In order to
    install the pinned version, the system packages `gcc` and `python-dev` must
    be installed.

Configuration
.............

Database
^^^^^^^^

privacyIDEA makes use of `SQLAlchemy <https://www.sqlalchemy.org>`_ to be able
to talk to different SQL-based databases. Our best experience is with
`MySQL <https://www.mysql.com/>`_ but SQLAlchemy supports many different
databases [#sqlaDialects]_.

The database server should be installed on the host or be otherwise reachable.

In order for privacyIDEA to use the database, a database user with the
appropriate privileges is needed.
The following SQL commands will create the database as well as a user in `MySQL`::

    CREATE DATABASE pi;
    CREATE USER "pi"@"localhost" IDENTIFIED BY "<dbsecret>";
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON pi.* TO "pi"@"localhost";

You must then add the database name, user and password to your `pi.cfg`. See
:ref:`cfgfile` for more information on the configuration.

Setting up privacyIDEA
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Additionally to the database connection a new ``PI_PEPPER`` and ``SECRET_KEY``
must be generated in order to secure the installation::

    PEPPER="$(tr -dc A-Za-z0-9_ </dev/urandom | head -c24)"
    echo "PI_PEPPER = '$PEPPER'" >> /path/to/pi.cfg
    SECRET="$(tr -dc A-Za-z0-9_ </dev/urandom | head -c24)"
    echo "SECRET_KEY = '$SECRET'" >> /path/to/pi.cfg

An encryption key for encrypting the secrets in the database and a key for
signing the :ref:`audit` log is also needed (the following commands should be
executed inside the virtual environment)::

    pi-manage create_enckey  # encryption key for the database
    pi-manage create_audit_keys  # key for verification of audit log entries

To create the database tables execute::

    pi-manage createdb

Stamping the database to the current database schema version is important for
the update process later::

    pi-manage db stamp head -d /opt/privacyidea/lib/privacyidea/migrations/

After creating a local administrative user with::

    pi-manage admin add <login>

the development server can be started with::

    pi-manage runserver

.. warning::
    The development server should not be used for a productive environment.

Webserver
^^^^^^^^^

To serve authentication requests and provide the management UI a
`WSGI <https://wsgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ capable webserver
like `Apache2 <https://httpd.apache.org/>`_ or `nginx <https://nginx.org/en>`_
is needed.

Setup and configuration of a webserver can be a complex procedure depending on
several parameter (host OS, SSL, internal network structure, ...).
Some example configuration can be found in the NetKnights GitHub
repositories [#nkgh]_. More on the WSGI setup for privacyIDEA can be found in
:ref:`wsgiscript`.
